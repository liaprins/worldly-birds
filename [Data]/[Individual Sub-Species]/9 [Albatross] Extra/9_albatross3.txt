The 45 Wilson''s St-Petrels were a group estimate (and is the number CBRC accepts) but I personally saw 16-18 (and have written details).

First year Short-tailed Albatross was the highlight of the trip -- big all brown body and wings with a giant pink bill!  Seeing all three species of north Pacific albatrosses on one trip was amazing.  Large shearwater flocks held two real good shearwaters -- Flesh-footed and Short-tailed, the latter landing near the boat for a close study.  Wilson''s and Fork-tailed Storm-Petrels were impressive as well.		obs169238	Elton	Morel	S5202338	eBird - Traveling  Count	EBIRD	600	96.558		1	0		1	1

Alas, the view -- looking west toward the sun -- precluded details of bill color but the huge long bill and bird''s size and shape was readily separable from Black-foots.

Pale pink bill glowing in late afternoon light.  The bird was far offshore, but not too bad for an albatross.  Too far for determining exact age, but looked all dark brown, with no white in the upper or undertail coverts.  I could not see white on the face or discern a paler belly.  The bill was bright pink.  Several Black-footed Albatrosses were seen at the same distance, and were useful for comparison.  	obs19105	Brian	Sullivan	S2992338	eBird - Stationary Count	EBIRD_CA	70			1	1		1	1

L769024	H	38.2349441	-123.5110474	2010-11-20	07:30:00	"Six-pak" trip aboard the Miss Anita, a small fishing boat that can attain speeds of 20 knots. Very comfortable and ideal for photography. With Steve Howell, Todd McGrath, Ken Petersen, Glen Tepke, and Martijn Verdoes. Despite ominous forecast, seas were fairly calm and we had little rain during most of the day. Cloudy to partly cloudy to sunny skies made for spectacular skies and good lighting throughout much of the trip. A memorable trip. The Short-tailed Albatross was a lifer for four of us and a state bird for five of us. Wow!	Extensively photographed. Seen at very close range, overflowing viewfinders! Probably a one-year old, but photo review pending. 	obs131779	Dan	Singer	S7133766	eBird - Traveling  Count	EBIRD	480	80.465		6	1		1	1

L769024	H	38.2349441	-123.5110474	2011-11-19	12:30:00	Private charter on the Miss Anita with Steve Howell, Ken Petersen, Martijn Verdoes and Ferenc Scheeren. Very chilly early with frost on the dock, but warmed up nicely for much of the day with enough wind to keep birds flying, and good light for photos. Swells were 10-12 feet with considerably larger ones periodically, inhibiting searching for birds on the horizon. NW wind shifted to the south by mid-day and the temperature dropped dramatically on the return to harbor. Additional photos of the STAL available on my Flickr site.	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27623718@N06/6379335687/" title="IMG_4702.jpg by Dan Singer, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6231/6379335687_46e758d21e.jpg" alt="IMG_4702.jpg"></a>	obs131779	Dan	Singer	S9188021	eBird - Traveling  Count	EBIRD	105	8.047		5	1		1	1

After investigating the area, it settled on the water about 0.1 mile from the slick near two large pink-legged gulls.  We carefully motored towards it, and it flew when we approached more tha half way.  This time, it passed down the length of the boat, bow to stern, as close as 30'.  After that it slowly drifted away.  Viewing conditions were better than average; skies were mostly clear, with bright sunshine from the south.  Winds were 15-20 knots from the east, so there were one meter waves on top of a very gentle, small swell from the west.  ----A dark albatross, appeared to be about 20% larger than Black-footed Albatross we had viewed 20 minutes earlier.  It was definitely heftier, or chestier, than BFAL.  The uniform dark sooty-brown plumage appeared fresh, with no sign of fading, feather wear or molt.  I could not see any white ont he face, rump or primaries.  I could sometimes see a paler area on the outer wing that appeared to be the shafts of the outer primaries.  The large beak was beautiful, with a vivid pink that seemed to have a bluish tinge and a small dark tip.  I did not see the legs or feet.  I did not note any flight differences between this bird and BFAL.	obs115431	Bill	Tweit	S10967905	eBird - Traveling  Count	EBIRD	480	112.654		16	0	G430947	1	1

There were large numbers of albatross, 45 Black-footed, behind the vessel.  As we approached the stern, I noted a large dark albatross flying towards our bow, with a very pale bill.  After loudly calling the bird out, we were able to watch it as it flew alongside us for quick, but excellent views.  --We stayed in the area for about a half hour, had several additional in-flight views, and were able to approach to within 50m as it sat on the water.----Exact location was 46 53.25N and 124 53.30W, in 1300' of water.  Sea surface temp was 56F.  Seas were good, with a 1.5m swell from the west, winds were light from the SW, Beaufort 1.  Sky was high overcast.  Ryan Shaw and Scott Mills were the other leaders on board, they both got excellent photos.  I noted the following details over the half hour as we refound it several times over the half hour.----A large, dark albatross, with a very dark head.  Only white in the plumage was the shafts of the outer primaries.  Head almost blackish in color, very difficult to discern dark iris against black plumage.  Legs dark grayish.  Beak is pink, not as vivid in tone as other STAL I have seen, with dark spot on tip.  In flight, is chestier than BFAL, with broader based wings.  Leading edge of --wing is relatively straight to tip when gliding, compared to BFAL which typically shows a swept-back look at the wrist when gliding.  Sitting on water it looks massive compared to BFAL.  Very large round head, makes neck look skinny.  Looked for bands when it flew, believe that it had a single silver band on right leg, photos should confirm.	obs115431	Bill	Tweit	S6709831	eBird - Traveling  Count	EBIRD	485	128.744		26	1	G184557	1	1
